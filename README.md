# Analyzing and Modeling US Trade Deficits and Tariff Impacts: A Gradient Boosting Approach

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of international trade data focusing on the United States' 2024 trade deficits, import-export dynamics, and the impact of tariffs implemented under the Trump administration. The analysis employs advanced data science techniques, specifically Gradient Boosting, to model and interpret these economic relationships.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises trade-related metrics between the US and various countries, including the trade deficit, export and import values, tariff rates alleged and responded to during Trump's administration, and population statistics for each country.
